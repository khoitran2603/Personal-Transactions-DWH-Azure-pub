# Personal Transaction Data Warehouse 

A personal data warehouse built to ingest, clean, standardize, and analyze multi-bank transaction data using a ***Bronze → Silver → Gold*** architecture.
The project focuses on traceability, repeatability, and analytical readiness, rather than real-time processing.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**
- Stores raw CSV data exactly as received from bank exports.
- Data is ingested from **Azure Blob Storage** into **Azure SQL Database**, then transferred to **Azure Data Lake** via **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** with minimal transformation.
2. **Silver Layer**
- Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization using **Databricks (PySpark)**.
- This layer applies business rules, categorization logic, location inference, and description normalization to produce analysis-ready transactional data.
3. **Gold Layer**
- Consolidates transactions across all banks into a single master table.
- Applies final business rules, overrides, and manual adjustments to become the **single source of truth** for dashboards, reporting, and downstream analytics.,

## 📖 Project Overview
This project simulates a production-style data warehouse using personal financial data.
It emphasizes:
- Clear data lineage from source files to analytics outputs
- Controlled refresh behavior (batch-oriented, non-incremental)
- Separation of raw data, business logic, and analytics layers

The warehouse is designed for monthly monitoring, acknowledging that bank exports are not real-time and may be subject to short delays.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
**Objective:**
Design and implement a scalable, maintainable data warehouse on Azure that ingests multi-bank transaction data, enforces clear data layering (Bronze/Silver/Gold), and supports reliable analytics and reporting.

**Specifications:**
- Azure Blob Storage for raw CSV ingestion
- Azure SQL Database for Bronze schema management and control logic
- Azure Data Factory for orchestration and data movement
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the analytical storage layer
- Databricks (PySpark) for Silver and Gold transformations
- Batch-based refresh strategy (TRUNCATE + INSERT / full reloads)
- Explicit execution order with no hidden dependencies

## 🗝️ Key Outputs
- Unified transaction master table across multiple banks
- Categorised income and expense records
- Monthly and historical spending trends
- Clean inputs for dashboards and forecasting models
- A reusable personal analytics framework that scales over time

## 📊 Dashboard Preview (Power BI)

> Dashboards are refreshed monthly to align with batch-based data ingestion and the availability of non-real-time bank exports.

The following Power BI dashboards are built on top of the **Gold layer**
and demonstrate how curated transaction data is used for monthly financial monitoring.

### Monthly Review
![Monthly Review Dashboard](docs/dashboards/monthly_review.png)

> High-level overview of income, expenses, and category distribution.
> Designed for quick monthly check-ins and trend awareness.

### Monthly Detail
![Monthly Detail Dashboard](docs/dashboards/monthly_detail.png)

> Transaction-level breakdown with category and time-based analysis,
> supporting deeper inspection and month-over-month comparison.
